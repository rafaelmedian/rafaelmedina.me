        p
        p After some market research and competitor’s analysis, we found that few similar mobile apps provide the same functionality, but they all offer complicated and buggy solutions. But after all, must condo management companies and board members used pen and paper, making this our main competitor. The places that did not do use the software at all.
        p Creating great user-centric oriented experiences and meet the admin user expectations by allowing them to quickly create, edit buildings and solve problems as soon as possible. And thus let the end users, the ones living in the condo trust and use their accounts.

        p Epics are stories that are providing an overview of the features. They helped me think through my design decisions, to create and provide a useful user experience. In our case, epics were that user can: create, edit, view, share and delete building units.
        p We continued with writing design stories, and agile technique to capture the functionality of a product. We created detailed descriptions of what an user can do.

        p Task flows helped us to think through the design, before a feature is actually developed. It helped us to interject the user into the flow of the application, and determine if the conceptual model agrees with the user model.

        p By watching our test users use and fumble through our product or even just imagining using it, we quickly identified areas, where the app is not simple or clear enough. 
        p We also committed to make simplicity our top priority from day one and filtered every wireframe and piece of copy through questions: Is it simple enough? Is there anything we could simplify?
